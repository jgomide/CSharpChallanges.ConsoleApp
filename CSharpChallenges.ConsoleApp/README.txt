* AgeMajority.ConsoleApp
--Check if the age is bigger than 18 years
---Version: 1.0 (First release)

* MajorMinorNumber.ConsoleApp
--Check between two numbers which is the biggest 
---Version: 1.0 (First release)
----Need to fix: Version 1.0 is using 'Regex.Split(input, @"\D+")' to get the numbers, but it ignore negative sign in the numbers (ep. -10 become 10)
